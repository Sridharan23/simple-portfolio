            <p class="section-two__desc">
                I'm SRIDHARAN M, a passionate and dedicated fresher web developer with a strong foundation in front-end
                and back-end development. I recently graduated from GOVERNMENT COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING THANJAVUR [ANNA
                UNIVERSITY] with a degree in BE-ECE Throughout my academic journey, I gained experience in HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, and modern frameworks like
                React . Additionally, I have a good understanding of server-side technologies such as Node.js and
                databases like MongoDB.These experiences have honed my problem-solving skills and given me a solid
                understanding of responsive
                design, user experience, and web performance optimization. I'm eager to contribute to a dynamic team
                where I can apply my skills and continue to grow as a developer.
                As an engineering graduate, I am looking for a challenging and enjoyable work environment where I can
                develop new skills and be encouraged to do my
                best for both myself and the organisation. Progress in the software engineering sector
                Looking forward to connecting and exploring exciting opportunities in the web development world!
